# OGRIT

1) Install IGP2, as specified on https://github.com/uoe-agents/IGP2.


One of the requirements of IGP2 is `carla`. This, though, is not a requirement for OGRIT. To run on machines that cannot 
install `carla`, do the following:
- Remove `carla==0.9.12` from `IGP2/requirements.txt`
- Remove `from igp2 import` (line 17) from `IGP2/igp2/__init__.py`
- Install IGP2 as per point 1 above

2) Install OGRIT with pip: 
    ```
    cd OGRIT
    pip install -e .
    ```

3) Copy the data from the [inD](https://www.ind-dataset.com/) dataset into `OGRIT/scenarios/data/ind`, and from the [rounD](https://www.round-dataset.com/) dataset into `OGRIT/scenarios/data/round`.


Please note: Run all the scripts below from the directory `OGRIT/`.

4) Extract the occlusions
    ```
    python scripts/extract_occlusions.py
    ```

5) Preprocess the data and Extract the base and indicator features:
   ```
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py --extract_indicator_features
   ```
   
   The task above may take hours to complete. If you have access to a SLURM sever, you could use the `SLURM_extract_occlusions_example.sh` SBATCH script
as an example to extract the base and indicator features. You need to create a script for each of the scenarios. 
More instructions are given in the example file mentioned.


7) Train OGRIT and the baseline (G-GRIT). Then calculate the evaluation metrics on the test set:

    ```
    python scripts/train_occlusion_grit.py
    python scripts/train_generalised_decision_trees.py
    python scripts/evaluate_models_from_features.py --models occlusion_grit,generalised_grit,occlusion_baseline
    python scripts/plot_results.py
    ```

# Occlusion detection

To visualise the occlusions generated by the occlusion detection algorithm, first complete steps 1-3 above and then, 
from the `OGRIT/` directory, run the following command:
```
python scripts/extract_occlusions_one_episode.py --debug
```

to visualise all the occlusions for each vehicle in the frame. Otherwise, 

```
python scripts/extract_occlusions_one_episode.py --debug_steps
```

to visualise the occlusion due to each obstacle in turn for each vehicle. 

By default, the two commands above will give the occlusions for the `bendplatz` scenario, episode `0`. 
You can change it by adding the `--scenario` and `--episode_idx` parameters.
For example, to get the occlusions in `frankenburg` episode `3`, you can run the following command:
```
python scripts/extract_occlusions_one_episode.py --scenario frankenburg --episode_idx 3 --debug
```
